Action hooks and filters give developers the ability to extend and customize WordPress, the world's most popular content management system. This course teaches you how to write action and filter code to modify WordPress core, themes, and plugins. Instructor Carrie Dils explains how action hooks and filters work and shows how to leverage priorities, arguments, and conditionals for more precise control over when your code executes. Next, learn how to identify the available hooks and filters for different WordPress pages, invoke callback functions, and execute hooks. In the third chapter, Carrie introduces a start-to-finish project where she shows how to build a simple plugin with hooks and filters, and closes with some tips for using third-party developer hooksâ€”and creating your own.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
